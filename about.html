                Hi! My name is Anne, I'm 23, I'm from California, and this is where I'm going to be blogging!  
            </p>
            <p>
                I am starting this blog on August 2, 2024. To keep it short and simple, I decided a while ago I wanted to both learn code and keep a better log of my life and interests. I bounced around a couple places, trying journaling physically and digitally, and learning to code from YouTube videos, but nothing really stuck. So here we are, at the intersection between both worlds! Hopefully having an actual goal in mind will help me learn coding at a much more gradual and natural pace, rather than trying to learn as much as I can as fast as I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, like a lot of my projects are, this may be short-lived. So do come along for the ride! I'm building this site from absolute scratch, so this may be a long process that I give up on and restart multiple times. I will make no promises on any update schedule or future maintenance, but I'll do what I want when I am up to the challenge!
            </p>
            <p>
                Last note: this is a very personal project of mine! Journaling is extremely personal, and while I won't be doxxing myself or sharing too many triggering topics, I'd still rather people treat it with respect. Please handle with care in comments or when sharing my hard work. Thanks so much!
            </p>

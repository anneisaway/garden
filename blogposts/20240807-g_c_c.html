            <p>
                I've been doing a bit more site cleaning up, but here's an actual life update too!

                I'm moving out of my current apartment, so I've been doing a lot of packing and cleaning. There's always something a little sad about cleaning house and moving, so yesterday was update-less. I've been torn up about the process so I may not say much about it, but know that that's what I'm doing.

                These days are full of playing video games, coding, and hoping I get a job and a PC. I've been playing Fields of Mistria (a cute farming simulation game), and I'm waiting for a Coral Island key from Kickstarter. I've been on a farming game kick lately and it's been great for the mental health, but bad for the wallet.

                I want a PC now more than ever to play the games I want without limits. Sighs.

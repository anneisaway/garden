                HELLO IT IS I: <b>ANNE</b>! WELCOME! üòá
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my very first entry on this page. I hope everyone who reads this is doing well. Personally, I know life is almost always rough, so shout-out to everyone for being here and being awesome. This first entry is a WIP currently, so expect the date and content to change. I just want to make sure everything is linking correctly and that I can do what I want to do with my site. üíê

                Today is my second day coding this site. I hope to slowly evolve with both my skills and writing through this project, and hopefully this site will help me capture my progress (at least with the writing side of things).
            </p>
            <p>
                My plans for the site include creating a guestbook, an interactive music page (that people can send recommendations to!), and better graphics and colors overall. I want to make this place cozy and inviting, while staying fairly simple and not too overwhelming. I'd give some examples, but I'm not sure what linking etiquettte is like here.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, I think I am good to just add more and tweak it here and there. I have the bare bones of the place, I just need to refine everything, maybe add pictures or gifs or videos, maybe some external links and more interesting colors. Maybe some new pages too? Unsure as of yet. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I think this is the end of my first entry. Just a simple update, no deep life stuff yet. Until next time!
